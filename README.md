# Capstone

This project is my capstone project for the IBM Data Science Certificate.  This project collected data concerning SpaceX falcon 9 rockets and determined factors which could lead to predicting whether or not a falcon 9 rocket would succesfully land its booster for re-use.

## Part 1: Data collection and cleaning
* Collecting, wrangling, and cleaning data from REST API [data_collection.ipynb](https://github.com/ddowler/Capstone/blob/master/data_collection.ipynb)
* Web Scrapping [data_collection_web_scrapping.ipynb](https://github.com/ddowler/Capstone/blob/master/data_collection_web_scrapping.ipynb)
## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analsis:
* SQL Queries [eda_using_sql.ipynb](https://github.com/ddowler/Capstone/blob/master/eda_using_sql.ipynb)
* Looking at launch site location using follium library [launch_site_follium.ipynb](https://github.com/ddowler/Capstone/blob/master/launch_site_follium.ipynb)
* Data Visualization [data_viz.ipynb](https://github.com/ddowler/Capstone/blob/master/data_viz.ipynb)
* Dashboard exploring launch site and payload landing success rates [spacex_dash_app.py](https://github.com/ddowler/Capstone/blob/master/spacex_dash_app.py)
## Part 3: Prediction:
* Using machine learning in Scikit-Learn library to predict if a booster landing will be successful [machine_learning_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/ddowler/Capstone/blob/master/machine_learning_prediction.ipynb)
## Part 4: Final Report
* Final Report Slideshow [final_report.pdf](https://github.com/ddowler/Capstone/blob/master/final_report.pdf)
