# Capstone

This project is my capstone project for the IBM Data Science Certificate.  This project collected data concerning SpaceX falcon 9 rockets and determined factors which could lead to predicting whether or not a falcon 9 rocket would succesfully land its booster for re-use.

## Part 1: Data collection and cleaning
* Collecting, wrangling, and cleaning data from REST API []
* Web Scrapping []
## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analsis:
* SQL Queries []
* Looking at launch site location using follium library []
* Data Visualization []
* Dashboard exploring launch site and payload landing success rates []
## Part 3: Prediction:
* Using machine learning in Scikit-Learn library to predict if a booster landing will be successful []
